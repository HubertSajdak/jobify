# Jobify is an application that helps you track your job application progress.

I used the existing backend and created the front of an app.

This project was created with:
-HTML/JSX
-CSS
-React + TypeScript + Redux Toolkit
-Styled Components
-I18n (three languages: English, Polish and German)
-Momentjs
-React Toastify
-Axios

User login/register validation is created on the backend side.

## Current functionalities:

-Registration/Logging,
-Adding a new job with statuses like (interview, pending, declined),
-Editing existing job,
-All jobs page,
-Profile page (where user can change it's informations)
