# Jobify is an application that helps you track your job application progress.

I used the existing backend and created the front of an app.

This project was created with:

- HTML/JSX,
- CSS,
- React + TypeScript + Redux Toolkit,
- Styled Components,
- I18n (three languages: English, Polish and German),
- Momentjs,
- React Toastify,
- Axios,
- Rechart.

User login/register validation is created on the backend side.

## Current functionalities:

- Registration/Logging,
- Adding a new job with statuses like (interview, pending, declined) and more,
- Editing existing job,
- All jobs page that shows our added job offers,
- Profile page (where user can change it's informations),
- Stats page that shows how many jobs we added in the last 6 months
- Three languages support
